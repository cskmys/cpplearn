= Notes

Use `default` for default constructors to initialize with all default values instead of junk.

Use safe casts instead of C-style round-bracketed cast which is unsafe.

Never ever write `using` statements in a header file.

Use {cpp} scoped enums instead of C-style enums.

In modern {cpp} the only preprocessor you'll probably need is `include`.
