== Intro

Creational patterns are key when it comes to establishing patterns around object creation and object lifecycle.

Modern {cpp} makes it very easy to implement and use creational patterns.

== SOLID

SOLID is a set of OOP design principles that aim to help write code that is easily:

* extensible:
+
Especially important if you are writing library or code that will be used by others.

* maintainable:
+
A small change in logic should not require you to make changes at 5 different places in code

* reusable.
+
The more generic and abstract your code is, the more pluggable it is.

=== Single responsibility
The most valuable principle of all.
A class or module or component must focus on doing one thing and one thing only.

 * Helps avoid writing "spaghetti" code, code that is tangled, and mixed up with various things.
Ensures that your code is easier to follow logically.

* Helps avoid writing "swiss-army knife" classes.
Hence, it allows you to implement proper separation of concerns.
This makes your code easy to change, and easier to test.

* Makes your code easy to maintain.
With proper separation, a larger code base can be easily seperated between teams to handle it.

==== What not to do
[source,cpp]
----
class CoffeeMachine {
    ...
    void PourCoffee(){ // <1>
        cout << "Pouring coffee" << endl;
    }

    void SendCoffeeMetrics(){ // <2>
        cout << "Sending metrics" << endl;
        ...
        request.uri("/metrics");
        ...
        request.perform();
    }
}
----
<1> `PourCoffee` belongs here as it contains code that is specific to the responsibility of `CoffeeMachine`

<2> `SendCoffeeMetrics` being in `CoffeeMachine` itself is not a problem.
However, `SendCoffeeMetrics` containing the implementation details about how to send the metrics is the problem coz any change related to how the metrics are managed will require a change here.
+
[WARNING]
====
Writing such specific implementation details makes it harder to test
====

==== What to do
[source,cpp]
----
class CoffeeService { // <1>
    ...
    SendMetrics(Metrics m){
        ...
        request.uri("/metrics");
        ...
        request.perform();
    }
};
class CoffeeMachine {
    ...
    void PourCoffee(){
        cout << "Pouring coffee" << endl;
    }

    void SendCoffeeMetrics(){ // <2>
        cout << "Sending metrics" << endl;
        ...
        coffeeService.SendMetrics(metrics);
    }
};
----
<1> Now, `CoffeeService` class takes care of how the metrics are sent.
Any change in the mechanism of how metrics are managed will incur change only in this class and not in `CoffeeMachine` class.

<2> `CoffeeMachine::SendCoffeeMetrics` doesn't contain any information on how the metrics are sent.
Now, `CoffeeService` class takes care of this.
+
[NOTE]
====
Though we have introduced a dependency, now `CoffeeMachine` being dependent on `CoffeeService`, The code of `CoffeeMachine` is still easier to test.
We can simply stub `CoffeeService` class.
====

=== Open-closed
Your code should be open for extension but closed for direct modification meaning it should be easy to extend a class's behavior without changing the code of the class itself.

* Adding new use cases to requirements will not require changing existing code.
The logic is generic enough for you to extend the existing code to more use cases.

* Helps prevent direct code changes in favor of extending existing APIs.
Hence, leads to well-defined APIs.
This is important for shareable and reusable code.

* Extending existing code, will make code reusable, and cuts down on redundant code.

==== What not to do
[source,cpp]
----
class CoffeeMachine {
    ...
    private:
        vector<int> settings = {1, 2, 3}; // <1>
    ...
    void RoastBySetting(int setting){
        ...
        switch(setting){ // <2>
            ...
        }
    }
};
----
<1> `CoffeeMachine::settings` are fixed.
Anytime a new roast setting needs to be added, this code needs to update.

<2> `CoffeeMachine::RoastBySetting` directly relies upon fixed settings, hence any addition to `CoffeeMachine::settings` will require code change here as well.

Hence, you'll need to directly modify the class to add the settings.
So, it is not closed for modification and open for extension.

==== What to do
[source,cpp]
----
class RoastingService {
    ...
    void Roast(RoastSetting const& setting){
        ...
    }
};

class CoffeeMachine {
    ...
    void RoastBySetting(RoastSetting setting){
        ...
        roastingService.Roast(&setting);
    }
};
----

When you add new `RoastSetting`, `CoffeeMachine` need not be changed.

// But don't you need to `RoastSetting`, and probably `RoastService` as well?
// I don't know it just looks like instead of making all the changes in one class you are making changes at multiple classes.
// but this is a toy example don't worry, have patience, we will see.

=== Liskov substitution principle

This is used for behavioral subtyping which allows you to write more generic code.
A class that inherits from a class will still have all the capabilities of the base class, hence a reference or a pointer of the base class can be used with the inherited class.

* You'll get flexibility to use different types.

* Well-defined abstractions which requires a minimum contract to follow

* Helps to reuse and extend the code

==== What to do
[source,cpp]
----
class Roaster { // <1>
    public:
        virtual void Roast();
};

class CoffeeRoaster : Roaster { // <2>
    public:
        void Roast(){
            // specific coffee implementation
        }
};

class EspressoRoaster : Roaster {
    public:
        void Roast(){
            // specific espresso implementation // <3>
        }
};

class RoastingService {
    ...
    void Roast(Roaster const& roaster){
        roaster.roast(); // <4>
    }
};
----
<1> Abstract base class that just defines the behavior
<2> Derived concrete class that implements the base class behavior
<3> Each derived class implement the behavior in their own way
<4> The code that uses this, need not worry about underlying derived class.

=== Interface segregation

Clients using your code should not be forced to depend upon methods or other abstractions that they don't need.
Clients should use just what they need.
Hence, it is always better to have multiple, separate and specific interfaces than one big giant interface for everything.

* Can reduce compile time as clients will use just what they need instead of a lot of extraneous code.

* It is far easy to maintain well-segregated multiple interfaces than one giant interface.

* Enforces proper separation of concerns

==== What not to do
[code, cpp]
----
class Machine { // <1>
    public:
        virtual void Roast();
        virtual void Pour();
        virtual void Grind();
};

class AllInOneCoffeeMachine : Machine { // <2>
    public:
        void Roast(){
            ...
        }
        void Pour(){
            ...
        }
        void Grind(){
            ...
        }
};

class SimpleCoffeeMachine : Machine { // <3>
    public:
        void Roast(){
            // not needed and has to be implemented // <4>
        }
        void Pour(){
            ... // only method that is needed
        }
        void Grind(){
            // not needed and has to be implemented
        }
};
----

<1> Base abstract interface
<2> Requires all methods of interface and is happy to implement all of that
<3> Doesn't require all methods of interface and is being forced to implement all of that
<4> One possible implementation would be to throw an exception, but again it was not required in the first place.

==== What not to do
[code, cpp]
----
class Roaster { // <1>
    public:
        virtual void Roast(); // <2>
};

class Pourer {
    public:
        virtual void Pour();
};

class Grinder {
    public:
        virtual void Grind();
};

class RobustMachine : Roaster, Pourer, Grinder { // <3>
    // <4>
};

class AllInOneCoffeeMachine : RobustMachine { // <5>
    public:
        void Roast(){
            ...
        }
        void Pour(){
            ...
        }
        void Grind(){
            ...
        }
};

class SimpleCoffeeMachine : Pourer { // <4>
    public:
        void Pour(){
            ... // only method that is needed
        }
};
----
<1> One interface for each behavior
<2> In practice, there will be more than one method
<3> A complex interface can be constructed for a complex machine by inheriting from multiple interfaces
<4> A complex machine will implement all the functionality brought in from complex interface
<5> A simpler machine that inherits only one interface, and hence implements it

=== Dependency inversion

Modules/classes higher up the chain should not directly depend upon lowerâ€‘level modules.
But instead, both the higher and lower level modules should depend upon a separate abstraction.

This facilitates and ensure code:

* Loosely coupled software

* Much more reusable code

* Proper separation of concerns

==== What not to do
[code, cpp]
----
class CoffeeMachine { // <1>
    ...
    vector<int> status;
    ...
};

class CoffeeTest {
    void Start(CoffeeMachine &machine){ // <2>
        for(auto bit : machine.staus){ // <3>
            // operate on status bits
        }
    }
};
----
<1> low-level module
<2> high-level module
<3> high-level module directly depends on low-level module, hence, the high-level module will need to change its code when the low-level module changes its implementation.
For example, if `CoffeeMachine::status` type is changed from `vector<int>` to `set<int>`, then `CoffeeTest::Start` will need change as well.

==== What to do
[code, cpp]
----
class CoffeeStatusReader { // <1>
    virtual void ReadStatus();
};

class CoffeeMachine : CoffeeStatusReader {
    vector<int> status;
    void ReadStatus(){ // <2>
        for(auto bit : status){
            ...
        }
    }
};

class CoffeeTest { // <3>
    void Start(CoffeeStatusReader & reader) {
        reader.ReadStatus();
    }
};
----
<1> shared abstraction used by both the high-level and low-level module
<2> low-level module now implements the shared abstraction
<3> high-level module no longer directly depends upon the high level module, it rather works on the shared abstraction.
Hence, now the low-level functionality in low-level module can change without requiring high-level module to change as well.
